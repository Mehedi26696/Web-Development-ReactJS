# Why React

- We can use states which means that once we update the state variable,it changes across the page
- We can split out app into multiple components and reuse those components
- React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM Manipulation
- Debugging and miantainance is easy
- Install->  npx create-react-app app_name
- start development using terminal "npm start"
